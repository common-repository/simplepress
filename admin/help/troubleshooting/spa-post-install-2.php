	<span class="spaicon-Forums post-install"></span>
	<p class="codex-sub">Create your first Forum Group</p>
	<p><b>Forums Menu > Create New Group</b><br>
	Your forums need to be contained in forum <b>Groups</b> so before you can create your first forum -
	you need to create your first forum group. After that, you can define all the forums you need!

	<div class="clearboth"></div>

	<span class="spaicon-UserGroups post-install"></span>
	<p class="codex-sub">If your user requirements are more complex</p>
	<p><b>User Groups Menu > Create New User Group</b><br>
	Two default User Groups were created during the install ('Members' and 'Guests') which is often enough to get started.
	But if your forums need to be a little more complex than this then we do recommend creating your
	User Groups and Permissions Sets before creating forums.
	</p>
	<div class="clearboth"></div>

	<span class="spaicon-Permissions post-install"></span>
	<p class="codex-sub">If you need to carefully Control Who Can Do What</p>
	<p><b>Permissions Menu > Add New Permission</b><br>
	Like User Groups, a handful of Permission Sets were created during install ('No Access', 'Read Only', 'Limited',
	'Standard', 'Full' and 'Moderator'). These define what a user can see and do and are often sufficient but if
	your Access Control requirements are more complex then creating the needed Permission Sets to match your User
	Groups before adding Forums is the best way forward.

	<div class="clearboth"></div>

	<span class="spaicon-Options post-install"></span>
	<p class="codex-sub">Do spend a little time investigating the options</p>
	<p><b>Options Menu</b><br>
	Here in the Options menu you will fnd some of the most important settings that control key behviours of your forum.
	We always strongly advise new users to just spend a few moments taking a look through the administration panels
	to familiarise themselves with the optional settings and to ensure that they are set as they would prefer them.
	</p>
	<div class="clearboth"></div>

	<p>Remember - for extra help, each admin section has a 'help' button that will pop up more descriptive and detailed text
	that explains what is needed in the way of data and settings.</p>
