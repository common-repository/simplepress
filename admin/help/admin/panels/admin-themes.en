[mobile-display]
These simple options are designed to try and help with the forum display when viewed on a mobile phone.<br /><br />
<b>Use Alternate WordPress Template</b><br />
If you are using a 'responsive' WordPress theme that is going to format your site on all size devices then it is best to leave
this option unchecked. However, if your WP theme is not responsive, one way you can improve the page display of the forum is
to use a full-width page template when viewed on a mobile phone. That is, of course, if your WordPress theme provides
such a template.<br />
If it does - then experiment with using an alternate page template.<br /><br />
<b>Remove Page Title Completely</b><br />
The page title can take up a lot of room at the top of the page. This option allows you to remove it for mobile phone
displays. Note please that SEO settings are not compromised.
